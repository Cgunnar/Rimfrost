# Rimfrost
My first try at making something resembling a game engine.

Project where I learn stuff so beware of the mess I leave behind me.


The Logger, AssimpLoader, and FrameTimer classes are mostly written by friends for a game project we worked on together.
Almost all the 3d assets in the Model folder are made by others.
